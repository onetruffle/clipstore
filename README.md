# clipstore

A quick little application to access your custom set of frequently used clipboard text snippets.

For each text snippet,
1. save the file in `assets/`
2. name the file appropriately
3. build the package (`flutter build apk --split-per-abi`), or just run it on a device (`flutter run --release`).
